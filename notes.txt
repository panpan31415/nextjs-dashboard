why optimize fonts?
Fonts play a significant role in the design
of a website, but using custom fonts in your
project can affect performance if the font
files need to be fetched and loaded.

Next.js automatically optimizes fonts in the
application when you use the next/font module.
It downloads font files at build time and hosts
them with your other static assets. This means 
when a user visits your application, 
there are no additional network requests 
for fonts which would impact performance.

#Why optimize navigation?

To link between pages, you'd traditionally use the <a> HTML element.

There's a full page refresh on each page navigation!

In Next.js, you can use the <Link /> Component to link between pages in your application. 
<Link> allows you to do client-side navigation with JavaScript.
