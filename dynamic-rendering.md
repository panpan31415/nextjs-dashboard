### What is Dynamic Rendering?
With dynamic rendering, content is rendered on the server for each user at request time (when the user visits the page). There are a couple of benefits of dynamic rendering:

- Real-Time Data - Dynamic rendering allows your application to display real-time or frequently updated data. This is ideal for applications where data changes often.

- User-Specific Content - It's easier to serve personalized content, such as dashboards or user profiles, and update the data based on user interaction.
  
- Request Time Information - Dynamic rendering allows you to access information that can only be known at request time, such as cookies or the URL search parameters.
