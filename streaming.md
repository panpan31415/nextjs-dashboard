With dynamic rendering, your application is only as fast as your slowest data fetch.

# What is streaming?
Streaming is a data transfer technique that allows you to break down a route into smaller "chunks" and progressively stream them from the server to the client as they become ready.

By streaming, you can prevent slow data requests from blocking your whole page. This allows the user to see and interact with parts of the page without waiting for all the data to load before any UI can be shown to the user.

Streaming works well with React's component model, as each component can be considered a chunk.

There are two ways you implement streaming in Next.js:

- At the page level, with the loading.tsx file.
  - loading.tsx is a special Next.js file built on top of Suspense, it allows you to create fallback UI to show as a replacement while page content loads.
- For specific components, with <Suspense>.

Route groups allow you to organize files into logical groups without affecting the URL path structure. When you create a new folder using parentheses (), the name won't be included in the URL path. So /dashboard/(overview)/page.tsx becomes /dashboard.

## Streaming a component
you can also be more granular and stream specific components using React Suspense.

Suspense allows you to defer rendering parts of your application until some condition is met (e.g. data is loaded). You can wrap your dynamic components in Suspense. Then, pass it a fallback component to show while the dynamic component loads.

If you remember the slow data request, fetchRevenue(), this is the request that is slowing down the whole page. Instead of blocking your whole page, you can use Suspense to stream only this component and immediately show the rest of the page's UI.


## Deciding where to place your Suspense boundaries

Where you place your Suspense boundaries will depend on a few things:

1. How you want the user to experience the page as it streams.
2. What content you want to prioritize.
3. If the components rely on data fetching.

- You could stream the whole page like we did with loading.tsx... but that may lead to a longer loading time if one of the components has a slow data fetch.

- You could stream every component individually... but that may lead to UI popping into the screen as it becomes ready.

Where you place your suspense boundaries will vary depending on your application.
 In general, it's good practice to move your data fetches down to the components that need it, and then wrap those components in Suspense. But there is nothing wrong with streaming the sections or the whole page if that's what your application needs.
